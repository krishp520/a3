    <p>
        A common perpection about a Computer Science student is a geeky, nerdy, antisocial guy, typing code on a dark low-light room with the light just of a computer and RGB lighted keyboard and mouse. 
            That is a stereotype of a programmer usually depicted in movies, well its not completely true but to some extent. 
        <br> Talking about myself, I am not a nerdy guy. Being ironic, I am completely opposite to what a programmer is usually known. I am a person who likes to go out frequently, a fun loving person.
         A person who wants to socialize with people, also wanting to sit quietly in a room and binge watch web-series, playing almost every sport and a foodie, this is what describes me.

            A DAY IN LIFE OF AN INTERNATIONAL STUDENT STUDYING COMPUTER SCIENCE

        <p id="p1">
            I am first year student at Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS. My day begins early morning as I am a student, attending classes at university is the primary task. Back in my home country, I was living with my parents. 
            Like a typical Indian family, my mother use to prepare coffee and breakfast for my whole family. Everything being served to me, I was not familiar to how daily chores were done. Here, in a foreign country away from home, one has to do everything on their own. 
            After waking up, I make coffee and breakfast and after completing that I leave for my classes. Earlier I just had to get ready, while I have to prepare everything which made me realise how much time it takes in the morning.

        <p id="p2">
            Earlier after coming here, understanding the teaching style and Education system. Now, since I have familiar with it, I am enjoying studying here. 
            When I head onto campus in the morning, there's a choice as to where do I spend the time in-between my timetabled lectures, lab sessions, tutorials. 
            During my free I head to the Library to study and complete some work and assignments which need to be done. 
        </p>

        <p id="p3">
            I have a Tuesday to Friday class schedule, while I work part-time on weekends. On weekdays after school, I go home and prepare dinner, wash utensils, it's a daily routine. 
            After completing these tasks, I feel tired and go to sleep. While Monday is an exception when I go out with friends, go out to dinner and relax. 
            No matter how my day turns out, they all have something in common. Social interaction, whether with classmates, roommates or specific time with friends.
        </p>

        <p id="p4">
            A day in the life of a computer science student is more than just coding at sunset. 
            It's not just sitting at a desk and staring at a computer screen for hours. Every experience is different and worthwhile, whether you prefer to use your free time productively or allow yourself to take breaks, play sports, and explore new places with friends. It all depends upon an individual.
